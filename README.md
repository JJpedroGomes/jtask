## About
This project is a **Task Management System** written in **Java 8**, developed primarily for **study purposes**. It aims to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently, offering features such as task creation, updates, and tracking. The project was built as a way to deepen my understanding of Java programming, object-oriented principles, and software development best practices.

During development, I experimented with various approaches, some of which may not adhere to best practices. As such, certain parts of the code could benefit from improvements and refactoring. This project serves as a learning experience and a starting point for exploring more robust solutions and design patterns in Java development.
